## üìã Overview  
This is a minimal aim assist implementation written in pure C. It uses low-level mouse hook to slow down your mouse when a target appears in your crosshair, helping you stay accurate and avoid missing shots.

## üíª How SetWindowsHookEx Works in Valorant  
Returning 1 after hooking the mouse will block it. However since Vanguard also hooks this function, it calls CallNextHookEx() after calling the function, preventing us from being able to return anything ourselves. 
However Vanguard doesn‚Äôt immediately call CallNextHookEx(), it first calls our function, giving us the opportunity to Sleep() during this time, which will freeze all mouse movement inputs.
The downside to this is that if the sleep amount is set too high, it could potentially freeze other mouse inputs, such as clicks as well.
