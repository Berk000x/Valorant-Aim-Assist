## üìã Overview  
This is a minimal aim assist implementation written in C. It uses low-level mouse hook to slow down your mouse when a target appears in your crosshair, helping you stay accurate and avoid missing shots.

## üíª How SetWindowsHookEx() Works in Valorant  
Returning true in the mouse hook callback will block mouse movement inputs. However since Vanguard also hooks this function, it calls CallNextHookEx() after calling the function, preventing us from being able to return anything ourselves. 
However Vanguard doesn‚Äôt immediately call CallNextHookEx(), it first calls our function, giving us the opportunity to Sleep() during this time, which will freeze all mouse movement inputs.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Usage
